# weather-website
This is a personal project as I am starting to officially learn Node.
I integrated a couple of API's (weatherstack and mapbox) in order to work with location services and weather services. 

You can view the finalized project by visiting the following Heroku link:

While it's not the prettiest website in the world, this was merely to learn the functionality aspect of the backend development using Node.
